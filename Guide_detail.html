				Problem Statement: Some students in XJTLU who are not familiar with the school and the surrounding often have question such as "where can i print document ", "how can i reapply for a student ID", "what is delicious near the school" and so on. This web APP, Puxiaobang, will solve these questions. Puxiaobang mainly includes two parts: Campus Life Strategy and Store Searching. The Campus Life Strategy will give the users who study in the XJTLU the strategy about the location of infrastructure in campus, traffic line, flow of activity and so on. Store Searching will collect and classify the information of stores near the campus and users can get the store information by using key-words or classification searching. Meanwhile, users can grade and evaluate the store they experienced.
